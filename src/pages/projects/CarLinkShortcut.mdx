This app opens Car Link 2.0 by when pressing the "NAV" button on some Joying/FYT/Xima radios.

When installed you need to set this app as the default navigation app in Settings -> General -> default navigation app.
After that you can press "NAV" or any other navigation button and it will open up Car Link.

If this app doesn't work, create an issue on Github (https://github.com/zalnaRs/CarLinkShortcut) with your Car Link app's package name. Currently this app only recognizes "com.syu.carlink".
